# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)'s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) :)

The repo is organized by year and day, so you can find my solution to e.g. [2015 day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9) in [`src/2015/09.rs`](./src/2015/09.rs).

To comply with Eric's [rules about copying](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying), I avoid copying any text from the problems -- so to understand what each solution is solving, you'll want to check the corresponding AoC page.
