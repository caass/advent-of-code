# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)'s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). The repo is organized by year and day, so you can find my solution to [2015 day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9) in [`src/2015/9.rs`](./src/2015/9.rs). Each file further contains functions named `part1` and `part2` corresponding to each part of the problem.

Documentation is sparse to try and comply with Eric's [rules about copying](https://adventofcode.com/2015/about#faq_copying). To understand what each problem is doing, check the Advent of Code website.
